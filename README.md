# Note: ðŸ‘‡

# All the code is kept inside a single HTML file to make things easier for beginners. This way, they wonâ€™t face any issues while trying to run or understand the project.
# Advanced users, however, are welcome to refactor the code and structure it in their preferred way for better organization or scalability.
